INFO:ConstraintSystem:59 - Constraint <NET "rx" LOC = "R7" |>
   [Keyboard_UCF.ucf(13)]: NET "rx" not found.  Please verify that:
   1. The specified design element actually exists in the original design.
   2. The specified object is spelled correctly in the constraint source file.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem - A target design object for the Locate constraint
   '<NET "rx" LOC = "R7" |> [Keyboard_UCF.ucf(13)]' could not be found and so
   the Locate constraint will be removed.

INFO:ConstraintSystem:59 - Constraint <IOSTANDARD = LVTTL ;>
   [Keyboard_UCF.ucf(13)]: NET "rx" not found.  Please verify that:
   1. The specified design element actually exists in the original design.
   2. The specified object is spelled correctly in the constraint source file.

INFO:ConstraintSystem - The Period constraint <NET "clk" PERIOD = 20.0ns HIGH
   40%;> [Keyboard_UCF.ucf(8)], is specified using the Net Period method which
   is not recommended. Please use the Timespec PERIOD method.
